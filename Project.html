    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>Like I said earlier I'm a Holacode student, but you'll find out more of What
      I'm learning. Right now let me talk to you about me!
      <div> I am 21 years old Born in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, but I left
      to the States when I was less than a year old and ended up being raised in
      Florida. Here in mexico I've had the chance to learn about a whole new country,
      culture and language (when I came back to Mexico I didnt really know spanish),
      it's been a huge adventure!
      Now here in Mexico I learned how to sew in Veracruz, participated in a runway,
      was a translater in The 22nd Central American and Caribbean Games and for OneSight,
      was studing Publicity in the UV, and even worked at a Call center here in Mexico city,
      but Now I'm learning how to code.</div> </p>
