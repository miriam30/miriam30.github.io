    <h2>Meet Ben...He's a Dragon!</h2>
    <p class="intro">A dragon is a legendary creature, typically scaled or fire-spewing
      and with serpentine, reptilian or avian traits, that features in the
      myths of many cultures around world, but this time we're going to talk
      about the Blue Ben Dragon</p>

      <p class="intro2">Blue Ben is a Legendary Dragon from Kilve in West Somerset, England.
        The skull of a fossilised Ichthyosaur on display in a local museum is
        sometimes pointed out as belonging to Blue Ben.</p>
        <h4>Legend says...</h4>
        <p class="intro3">It’s said that there once was a massive blue dragon who lived in the
          shale caves along the coast.  Being a fire breather, he would cool himself
          in the nearby waters on warm summer days.  But his size was a problem on the
          mud flats that bordered his home; he feared to get stuck in a mire.  And so
          he built himself a causeway of limestone through the mud to provide easy passage
          to the sea.</p>

          <p class="intro4">It’s said that one day the devil discovered Blue Ben’s lair, and the evil one
          enslaved the great beast, riding him like a steed through the fires of Hell.
          The devil kept his prize until the dragon escaped in a fury and hurriedly made
          his way back to the safety of his cave.  Forgetting about the mud flats in his haste,
          Blue Ben became stuck, struggling to pull his great weight onto the causeway.  Finally,
          exhausted and defeated by his ordeal, the dragon slowly succumbed to death, and over
          the eons his carcass became a massive fossil on the beach.</p>
