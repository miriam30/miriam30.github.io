    <p>Like I said earlier I'm a Holacode student, but you'll find out more of What I'm learning. Right now let me talk to you about me!
      <div> I am 21 years old Born in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, but I left to the States when I was less than a year old and ended up being raised in Florida. Here in mexico I've had the chance to learn about a whole new country, culture and language (when
        I came back to Mexico I didnt really know spanish), it's been a huge adventure! Now here in Mexico I learned how to sew in Veracruz, participated in a runway, was a translater in The 22nd Central American and Caribbean Games and for OneSight,
        was studing Publicity in the UV, and even worked at a Call center here in Mexico city, but Now I'm learning how to code.</div>
